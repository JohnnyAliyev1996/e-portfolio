| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I explored a wide range of database management systems including relational databases like SQL and PostgreSQL, as well as non-relational databases such as MongoDB. I also learned about data warehouses, cloud storage, and big data technologies like Hadoop and data lakes.  | The unit covered fundamental concepts and design theories behind various DBMS types. I gained insight into the strengths and limitations of different database models and how these influence their application in diverse programming and data environments.                                           |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Comparing different DBMS types helped me understand why specific systems are better suited for particular use cases. For example, relational databases excel at structured data with strong integrity needs, while non-relational models handle unstructured, large-scale data more flexibly. | This broadened my perspective on database design decisions, emphasizing the need to choose the right DBMS based on application requirements, data volume, and performance constraints. It also reinforced the importance of staying current with evolving data technologies and paradigms.              |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | I plan to deepen my hands-on experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases by building projects that leverage their unique capabilities. I will also explore cloud-based DBMS solutions and big data platforms to enhance my practical understanding.                                          | Professionally, I want to focus on integrating various DBMS technologies into hybrid data architectures and learn how to optimize database performance and scalability for complex applications. I’m interested in studying advanced concepts like distributed databases and data lakes in more detail. |
