| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I practiced breaking down an un-normalised table into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, step by step. I then used the normalized tables to build a relational database model and tested it for errors and anomalies using my chosen database software.                     | The unit focused on understanding functional dependencies, data attributes, and constraints that govern database normalization. I learned how to identify key dependencies and the importance of enforcing constraints to ensure data integrity and usability.          |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Working hands-on with normalization helped me see how each normal form progressively reduces redundancy and potential anomalies. Building and testing the database reinforced the importance of accurate modeling to prevent future errors in data retrieval and updates. | This experience solidified my understanding of database theory applied in practice and taught me the value of iterative testing and validation. It also showed me how constraints and dependencies directly affect the reliability and efficiency of a database system. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | I plan to apply normalization steps systematically in future database projects and improve my ability to spot and resolve anomalies early in the design phase. I will also gain more experience using database management systems for building and testing models.        | Going forward, I want to explore more advanced database features like indexing, query optimization, and stored procedures to further enhance database performance and reliability. I also aim to deepen my understanding of constraint management in complex datasets.  |
