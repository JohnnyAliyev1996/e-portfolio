| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I explored different data sources, learned about data collection methods, and practiced fact checking and verifying data integrity. I also reviewed how data formats affect storage needs and evaluated using web services and crowd-sourced data.                                                                                     | We covered how to identify reliable data sources, check their validity, and why data integrity is critical for business decisions. The unit also discussed technical aspects of storing large volumes of data and the pros and cons of collecting data from open web sources.         |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Practicing fact finding showed me that not all data sources are equally trustworthy, even if they seem popular. This made me realize the importance of critical thinking and verification when working with external data. Evaluating web services highlighted ethical concerns and data quality challenges, which I hadn’t fully considered before. | Linking this with what I knew before, I saw that data collection isn’t just technical—it also involves assessing biases, completeness, and legal implications. This changed my perspective: good data work begins before analysis, at the point of source selection and verification. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | In future projects, I’ll prioritize checking data integrity before analysis, and document my data sources carefully. I’ll also explore tools to automate parts of the fact-checking process.                                                                                                                                                         | Professionally, I want to learn more about data governance frameworks and standards that guide data collection. I’ll also look deeper into APIs and web scraping tools to better understand how to responsibly collect data from online sources.                                      |
