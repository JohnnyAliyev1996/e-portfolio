| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I explored how APIs enable data parsing and communication between different software systems. I studied the security requirements needed to maintain API robustness and examined common challenges faced during API implementation.                         | The unit provided insights into API design and configuration, emphasizing their role in enabling seamless data exchange. I learned about best practices to secure APIs and understood typical issues that can arise, such as authentication failures and data consistency problems.                |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Working with API concepts made me appreciate their critical role in modern software ecosystems and how security vulnerabilities can impact the whole system. It also showed me the importance of careful planning in API design to ensure reliability and data integrity. | This deepened my understanding of API security mechanisms like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. It also highlighted the need for thorough testing and monitoring to detect and mitigate issues early in deployment, ensuring smooth inter-process communication and data parsing. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | I plan to practice building and securing APIs using popular frameworks and tools, focusing on common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. I will also experiment with API integration in different platforms to enhance my practical skills.                          | Professionally, I aim to learn more about advanced API security protocols such as OAuth and JWT, and explore automated tools for API testing and monitoring. This will help me build more secure, scalable, and maintainable data integration solutions.                                           |
