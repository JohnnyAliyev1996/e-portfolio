| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I studied various compliance frameworks and regulatory requirements related to data management. I explored individual data rights, organizational obligations, and examined standards and regulations affecting different industries and stakeholders.     | The unit emphasized the legal and ethical dimensions of data handling, highlighting key regulations and standards that govern data storage, processing, and sharing. I learned how compliance frameworks protect both individuals and organizations in managing data responsibly.             |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Understanding compliance obligations helped me realize the importance of embedding regulatory requirements into data processes to avoid legal risks. It also clarified how respecting individual data rights is crucial for trust and transparency between stakeholders. | This deepened my awareness of the intersection between data management and law, showing that effective data governance requires constant vigilance and adherence to evolving standards. It also reinforced the need to design systems that inherently support compliance and data protection. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | Moving forward, I plan to apply compliance checks routinely in data projects and keep updated on relevant regulations. I will also advocate for clear data policies and transparency in any organizational context I work in.                                            | Professionally, I want to study specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific standards in more detail to better advise on compliance strategies. I also aim to explore tools that automate compliance monitoring and reporting to enhance governance practices.             |
