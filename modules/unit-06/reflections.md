| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I explored the principles of designing relational databases, focusing on key fields, data integrity, and normalization techniques. I learned how to identify anomalies in databases and practiced creating logical and physical database designs.            | The unit introduced key database concepts such as relational structures, normalization forms, and the importance of eliminating data anomalies. I gained a clearer understanding of the terminology and processes involved in constructing robust database architectures.                  |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Working through database design exercises made me realize how crucial normalization is for maintaining data integrity and preventing redundancy. Understanding key fields helped me see how tables relate and how data retrieval depends on well-structured relationships. | This deepened my knowledge of database theory, highlighting the practical impact of normalization on real-world data storage and retrieval. It also emphasized the need for careful planning in both logical and physical design stages to ensure efficient and scalable database systems. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | In future projects, I plan to apply normalization principles more rigorously and double-check for anomalies during design. I want to practice creating both logical and physical database schemas to enhance my ability to design effective data architectures.            | Professionally, I aim to further study advanced database design techniques, including optimization and indexing strategies, to improve performance. I also want to explore tools that assist in database modeling and normalization to streamline the design process.                      |
