| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | We explored big data fundamentals in class, including the 4Vs (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity). I practiced using Jupyter Notebook in the Codio environment, which was new to me.                                                                                                                                                   | The unit introduced big data’s characteristics and why data is exponentially growing and complex. We also reviewed tools, methodologies, and security requirements for data management systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Using Jupyter Notebook practically showed me how essential such tools are for working with large and complex datasets. I realized managing data isn’t only about storage but about making it usable, secure, and accessible. This changed my view of data work from a purely technical process to a strategic task within organizations. | The 4Vs framework helped me see why big data is fundamentally different from traditional data. I now understand that velocity and variety challenge processing systems as much as volume does. Linking this with what I previously knew about data cleaning, I see why big data requires new methodologies and governance models. Security requirements also stood out as a key risk area I hadn’t fully appreciated before. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | In the next units, I plan to explore Jupyter Notebook more deeply and experiment with larger datasets. When working in projects, I will also pay closer attention to data security planning from the start, rather than as an afterthought.                                                                                              | Professionally, I will explore how big data management tools and frameworks can be applied in real-world projects. I also plan to read more about ethical data governance and the skill sets required to manage big data environments responsibly.                                                                                                                                                                           |
