| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I learned about transaction processing in databases, focusing on how systems maintain data integrity even in the event of failures. I studied the ACID properties and how transaction managers ensure consistent database states. | The unit explained the critical concepts of transaction consistency, including atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. I gained an understanding of how scheduled transactions, checkpoints, and recovery mechanisms help maintain reliable data despite concurrent operations and system crashes. |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Understanding how transactions are managed made me appreciate the complexity behind maintaining data reliability in multi-user environments. It highlighted the importance of system design to prevent partial or corrupted data updates.       | This deepened my knowledge of DBMS internals and reinforced why transaction management is vital for applications that require precise and reliable data handling. It also made clear the role of recovery protocols in minimizing data loss during unexpected failures.                                       |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | I plan to explore practical transaction management by working with database systems that support ACID properties and experiment with failure scenarios to see recovery in action.                                                               | Going forward, I want to study advanced recovery techniques, distributed transactions, and how modern databases implement transaction isolation levels to balance performance and consistency. This will help me build more robust and fault-tolerant data systems.                                           |
