| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | This unit focused on different data types and formats: structured, quasi-structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. I also worked on practical exercises in Python to handle different data formats and experimented with using APIs to parse data.                        | We reviewed how data is represented and stored, and why choosing the right format matters. The unit also covered practical applications of data types in programming and how APIs help transfer and transform data across systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Working with real data examples helped me understand why the choice of format impacts storage efficiency, data parsing, and later analysis. Using Python routines to handle formats like JSON and CSV made me realize how crucial format awareness is when building data pipelines. | I now see that structured data isn’t always the best; sometimes semi-structured or unstructured data formats are more practical, depending on the context. Connecting this to my previous knowledge, I recognized that APIs are powerful because they can translate between formats and systems, making data integration smoother. This changed my perspective on data engineering as more than just code — it’s also about understanding data shape and flow. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | In future projects, I plan to pay more attention to data format decisions early in design. I’ll also keep practicing with APIs and data parsing tasks to become more fluent in real-world data integration work.                                                                    | Professionally, I aim to deepen my skills in Python for data transformation tasks and learn about more complex formats like XML or Parquet. I also plan to explore how APIs are built and documented, which will help me design better systems that can share data seamlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
