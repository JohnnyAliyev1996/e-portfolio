| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I practiced cleaning real-world data from UNICEF surveys using Python. I also experimented with converting datasets to CSV, writing scripts to automate parts of the cleaning process, and scraping data from web pages.                                                                         | The unit focused on how automation supports data cleaning and the importance of clear, task-focused scripts. We also looked at how data models help represent relationships and why understanding inputs and outputs is crucial for automation.                                                                            |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Working with real survey data showed me that manual cleaning can be time-consuming and prone to error. Writing Python scripts for automation made the process more efficient and reproducible. It made me realize the value of scripting skills beyond small datasets—especially when data updates frequently. | This built on my earlier learning by showing that automation isn’t just about writing code—it’s about designing clear workflows that anticipate data variability and handle exceptions. I also understood that data models are not just diagrams, but conceptual tools that help structure automation processes logically. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | In future projects, I plan to incorporate automation early and refine my scripts to handle unexpected data issues. I’ll also document my cleaning process so it can be reused by others.                                                                                                                       | Professionally, I want to learn more about advanced data scraping techniques, machine learning strategies for cleaning, and database architectures. This will help me build more robust, scalable, and maintainable data pipelines.                                                                                        |
