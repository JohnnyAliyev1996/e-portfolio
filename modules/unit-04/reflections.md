| **What? (Description – the shortest part)** | In this unit, I explored practical steps of cleaning and transforming data within a data pipeline. I practiced identifying missing values, inconsistencies, and performed transformations to prepare data for analysis.                                     | The unit introduced concepts like data cleaning, transformation, and why these steps are critical. We also reviewed how design requirements and automation can improve the data preparation process.                                                                                       |
| **So what? (Interpretation – analysis)**    | Working directly on data cleaning tasks showed me how even small inconsistencies can significantly affect analysis results. It made me realize that data cleaning isn’t a single step, but an iterative and often creative process that depends on context. | This connected with my earlier understanding of data pipelines but expanded it by emphasizing design automation and how consistent processes help maintain data quality over time. It also made me see that proper cleaning is not just technical—it supports trust in the final analysis. |
| **What next? (Outcome)**                    | For future projects, I’ll build cleaning routines early in the workflow and document each step, so others can review or replicate the process. I’ll also explore Python libraries and tools that help automate repetitive cleaning tasks.                   | Professionally, I want to learn advanced transformation techniques, such as feature engineering and scaling methods, to improve data quality for machine learning projects. I also plan to deepen my understanding of process automation tools in data engineering.                        |
